//! Closures and upvalue cells (port `lfunc.cpp`).
//!
//! A [`Closure`] pairs a prototype with the upvalue cells it captures. An
//! [`UpVal`] is open while it still points into a live thread's register stack,
//! or closed once it owns its value. The open form is `{thread, slot,
//! generation}`, replacing upstream's pointer patching: the
//! generation guards against the thread's arena slot being reused.
