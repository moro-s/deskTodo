# Direct Luau Smoketests

This directory holds the checked-in Luau smoketest suite for `eguidev_demo`.

## Conventions

- Every smoketest file is a self-contained `.luau` script.
- Each script must establish its own starting state with `eguidev.fixture(...)` before interacting
  with the UI. Fixtures wait for their ready conditions, so setup-specific
  widget waits should only appear when the test is exercising an interaction after setup.
- Scripts should assert visible app behavior and public API results rather than internal details.
- `edev smoke` ignores a script's final return value; use assertions for pass/fail and
  `eguidev.log(...)` for extra diagnostics.
- Keep files independent. Do not rely on state left behind by an earlier smoketest.

## Run

```sh
cargo xtask smoke
```

Useful authoring commands:

```sh
cargo xtask smoke --list
cargo xtask smoke --only '*visual*'
cargo xtask smoke --only '*visual*' --only '*layout*'
cargo xtask smoke --repeat 5 --only '*layout*'
cargo xtask smoke --until-fail 50
cargo xtask smoke --bundle --fail-fast
```
